## Coding Standards

### General

1. Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
2. Follow ESLint rules. Use the recommended Next.js ESLint configuration.
3. Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.
4. Maximum line length: 100 characters.
5. Use 2 spaces for indentation.
6. Other scripts or files referenced in the code should be in the comments at the top of the document.

### Naming Conventions

1. Use camelCase for variable and function names.
2. Use PascalCase for class and interface names.
3. Use PascalCase for React components.
4. Use UPPER_CASE for constants.
5. Use kebab-case for file names.

Examples:

```typescript
const  userId = 1;

function  calculateTotal() { ... }
class  UserProfile { ... }
interface  UserData { ... }

const  MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3;

// File: user-profile.tsx
```

### React and Next.js

1. Use functional components with hooks instead of class components.
2. Use named exports for components.
3. Co-locate component files with their styles and tests.
4. Use the `useCallback` hook for functions passed as props to child components.
5. Use the `useMemo` hook for expensive computations.
6. Prefer static generation (`getStaticProps`) over server-side rendering when possible.

Example:

```typescript
// user-profile.tsx
import { useState, useCallback } from  'react';

export  function  UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {
const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);

const  handleEdit = useCallback(() => {
setIsEditing(true);

}, []);

return ( ... );

}

```

### State Management

1. Use React Context for global state when Redux is overkill.
2. Keep state as local as possible.
3. Use the `useState` hook for component-level state.
4. Use the `useReducer` hook for complex state logic.

### Asynchronous Operations

1. Use `async/await` instead of `.then()` chains for better readability.
2. Handle errors with try/catch blocks.
3. Use Next.js's `SWR` or `React Query` for data fetching and caching.

Example:

```typescript
async  function  fetchUserData(userId: number) {
try {
const  response = await  fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);

if (!response.ok) throw  new  Error('Failed to fetch user data');

return  await  response.json();

} catch (error) {
console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);

throw  error;

}
}
```

### PocketBase Integration

1. Create a separate file for PocketBase configuration and initialization.
2. Use PocketBase's TypeScript support for better type checking.
3. Wrap PocketBase calls in custom hooks or utility functions for reusability.

Example:

```typescript
// pocketbase.ts
import  PocketBase  from  'pocketbase';

export  const  pb = new  PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');

// hooks/use-records.ts

import { useState, useEffect } from  'react';

import { pb } from  '../pocketbase';

export  function  useRecords(collection: string) {

const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);

useEffect(() => {

pb.collection(collection).getFullList().then(setRecords);

}, [collection]);

return  records;
}

```
### Google Generative AI Integration

1. Keep API keys and sensitive information in environment variables.
2. Create utility functions for common AI operations.
3. Handle API rate limiting and errors gracefully.

Example:

```typescript

// utils/ai.ts
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from  '@google/generative-ai';

const  genAI = new  GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY);

export  async  function  generateSummary(text: string) {
try {
const  model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model:  'gemini-pro' });

const  result = await  model.generateContent(text);

return  result.response.text();
} catch (error) {
console.error('Error generating summary:', error);

throw  error;

}
}
```

### Testing

1. Write unit tests for utility functions and hooks.
2. Write integration tests for API routes.
3. Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
4. Use Jest for unit and integration testing.
5. Use Cypress for end-to-end testing.
6. Aim for at least 80% test coverage.

### Comments and Documentation

1. Use JSDoc comments for functions and components.
2. Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.
3. Document complex algorithms and business logic.
4. Use TODO comments for future improvements, but address them promptly.

Example:

```typescript
/**
* Calculates the total score for an RFP response.
* @param  {Response}  response - The RFP response object
* @param  {Criteria}  criteria - The scoring criteria
* @returns  {number} The total score
*/

function  calculateResponseScore(response: Response, criteria: Criteria): number {
// TODO: Implement weighted scoring
let  totalScore = 0;
// ... calculation logic
return  totalScore;
}
```

### Version Control

1. Write clear, concise commit messages.
2. Use feature branches for new features or significant changes.
3. Squash commits before merging to main branch.
4. Use Pull Requests for code reviews.

Commit message format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<body>
<footer>

```

Example:

```
feat(user-profile): add ability to edit user bio
- Added an edit button to the user profile component
- Implemented a modal for editing the bio
- Updated the API to handle bio updates
Closes #123

```

These coding standards provide a solid foundation for maintaining consistency and quality in the codebase. They can be adjusted and expanded as the project evolves and team preferences become clearer.

## Testing

(To be filled with testing strategy, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests)

## Documentation

- Code should be self-documenting where possible
- Complex functions should include JSDoc comments
- API endpoints should be documented (format to be decided)

## Performance Considerations

Given the nature of our RFP application and the optimization capabilities of Next.js, we should focus on the following performance areas:

### 1. Image Optimization

Utilize the `next/image` component for all images, including user avatars and any images that might be part of RFP documents or summaries.

- Implement lazy loading for images not immediately visible.
- Use appropriate sizes and formats to reduce bandwidth usage.
- Consider using the `priority` attribute for above-the-fold images.

Example:
```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

function Avatar({ user }) {
  return (
    <Image
      src={user.avatarUrl}
      alt={`${user.name}'s avatar`}
      width={64}
      height={64}
      priority
    />
  )
}
```

### 2. Font Optimization

Use the `next/font` module to optimize web fonts, which is crucial for maintaining consistent typography across the application.

- Implement font subsetting to reduce font file sizes.
- Use `next/font/google` for Google Fonts or `next/font/local` for self-hosted fonts.

Example:
```jsx
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={inter.className}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### 3. Metadata and SEO Optimization

Implement the Metadata API to improve SEO and social media sharing capabilities.

- Use dynamic metadata generation for RFP-specific pages.
- Implement Open Graph images for better social media sharing.

Example:
```jsx
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const rfp = await fetchRFP(params.id)
  return {
    title: `RFP: ${rfp.title}`,
    description: rfp.summary,
    openGraph: {
      images: [{ url: `/api/og?title=${encodeURIComponent(rfp.title)}` }],
    },
  }
}
```

### 4. Route Optimization

Utilize Next.js App Router features for optimal routing and page loading.

- Implement loading.js files for instant loading states.
- Use error.js files for graceful error handling.
- Leverage server components where possible to reduce client-side JavaScript.

### 5. Third-Party Script Optimization

Use the `next/script` component to optimize loading of third-party scripts, such as analytics or any external libraries required for RFP processing.

Example:
```jsx
import Script from 'next/script'

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <>
      <Script
        src="https://example.com/analytics.js"
        strategy="lazyOnload"
      />
      {/* Dashboard content */}
    </>
  )
}
```

### 6. API Route Optimization

Optimize API routes, especially for AI-powered features and database interactions.

- Implement appropriate caching strategies.
- Use edge functions for low-latency requirements.

### 7. Static Asset Optimization

Utilize the `/public` directory for static assets and leverage CDN caching for frequently accessed files.

### 8. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

Implement code splitting and lazy loading for large components or libraries, especially in areas like document viewing or complex form submissions.

Example:
```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const DynamicChart = dynamic(() => import('../components/Chart'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading chart...</p>,
  ssr: false
})
```

### 9. Performance Monitoring

Implement performance monitoring to continuously track and improve application performance.

- Use Next.js Speed Insights for performance metrics.
- Consider implementing OpenTelemetry for more detailed performance tracking.

### 10. Memory Optimization

Given the potential for large document processing:

- Implement efficient data structures for storing and processing RFP data.
- Use streaming for large file uploads and downloads.
- Implement pagination or virtualization for long lists of RFPs or comments.

By focusing on these areas, we can ensure that our RFP application leverages Next.js's built-in optimizations while addressing the specific performance needs of our feature set. Regular performance audits and user feedback will be crucial in maintaining and improving performance over time.

## Security Guidelines

### 1. Data Encryption

#### In Transit

- Implement SSL/TLS encryption for all data in transit.
- Use HTTPS for all communications between the client and server.
- Configure secure SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers.

#### At Rest

- Encrypt sensitive data before storing in PocketBase.
- Use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) for data at rest.
- Securely manage encryption keys, potentially using a key management service.

## #2. Authentication

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts.
- Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) for storing user passwords.
- Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for maintaining user sessions.

### 3. Authorization and Access Control

- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions.
- Define roles: Admin, Power User, User, etc.
- Create a hierarchical structure for companies, departments, and sub-companies.
- Implement access control checks at both the frontend and backend.

Example structure:
```javascript
const accessLevels = {
  COMPANY: 3,
  SUBCOMPANY: 2,
  DEPARTMENT: 1
};

function canAccessResource(user, resource) {
  return user.accessLevel >= resource.requiredAccessLevel;
}
```

### 4. Input Validation and Sanitization

- Validate and sanitize all user inputs on both client and server sides.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information.

### 5. API Security

- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of API endpoints.
- Use API keys for external integrations.
- Validate and sanitize all API inputs.

Example using Express middleware:
```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use("/api/", apiLimiter);
```

### 6. File Upload Security

- Implement file type and size restrictions.
- Scan uploaded files for malware.
- Store uploaded files in a secure location, separate from the web root.

### 7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

- Use Next.js's built-in XSS protection.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
- Sanitize user-generated content before rendering.

### 8. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

- Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations.
- Use SameSite cookie attribute to limit CSRF vulnerabilities.

### 9. Security Headers

- Implement security headers using a middleware in Next.js:
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - Referrer-Policy

Example:
```javascript
// pages/_app.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request) {
  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)
  requestHeaders.set('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY')
  requestHeaders.set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff')
  requestHeaders.set('Referrer-Policy', 'origin-when-cross-origin')
  requestHeaders.set('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains')

  return NextResponse.next({
    request: {
      headers: requestHeaders,
    },
  })
}
```

### 10. Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- Implement a process for reviewing and approving dependency updates.

### 11. Logging and Monitoring

- Implement comprehensive logging for security-relevant events.
- Use a centralized log management system.
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities.
- Regularly review logs and conduct security audits.

### 12. Secure Development Practices

- Conduct regular security training for developers.
- Implement code review processes with a focus on security.
- Use automated security scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline.

### 13. Data Backup and Recovery

- Implement regular, encrypted backups of all critical data.
- Test backup restoration processes regularly.
- Store backups in a secure, offsite location.

### 14. Compliance

- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Implement data retention and deletion policies.
- Provide mechanisms for users to request their data or its deletion.

### 15. Third-Party Integrations

- Thoroughly vet and regularly review any third-party services or APIs used.
- Use minimal permissions when integrating with third-party services.
- Monitor third-party access and usage patterns.

By implementing these security measures, we can create a robust security framework for our RFP application. Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of these measures. As the application evolves, this security plan should be reviewed and updated accordingly.
